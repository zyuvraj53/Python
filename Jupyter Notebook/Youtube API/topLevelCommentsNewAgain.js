Wonderful videos! Thank you so much!`],
[`"Why am I gaining wight when all I'm eating is salads"

The salads:`],
[`I love Armadillo eggs! The kind you made though can get a little overpowering, all the ingredients were right but the better ones in my opinion use smaller peppers that are more bite sized (maybe 2 or 3 bites). The big ones are common, but the smaller ones are far more balanced. In Texas we usually don't fry our jalepeno poppers either, we just wrap them in bacon and smoke/grill them, so the Armadillo egg is just kind of an evolution of our poppers.

You should do more regional American episodes, there are so many regional foods in the states you really almost have to treat it like Europe in some ways. We've got things like boudin in Lousiana, Chow Chow (a common southern pickle relish), Stuffies from Rhode Island, Akutaq in Alaska, Lutefisk from Minnesota/Wiscosin, Chitlins, the Onion Smash burger from Oklahoma... the list goes on and on and on. You could do a whole series on them if you really wanted to.`],
[`Frito Pie. It‚Äôs about as much of a ‚Äúpie‚Äù as those ‚Äúsalads‚Äù were salads.`],
[`One thing I realize from this video is many Americans don't have access to fresh foods. A lot of these recipes were "use what you got in the pantry" foods. Interesting. Southeast cuisine is so much different but I think it's because of the abundance of produce that grows in that region.`],
[`You're always respectful with the foods you don't love, but you give me LIFE when you take the first bite of something you do. I can see rays of light and rainbows and sheer happiness coming through your eyes and you don't even need words to describe the dish. Stay foodie, Beryl :)`],
[`OMG OMG THANKS FOR INCLUDING ME!!!! I hope everyone tries ambrosia salad!!`],
[`My dad taught me at a very early age, just as the girl from NY said, ‚ÄòTry everything at least once. You may not like it but you can‚Äôt judge without trying it first and you may be surprised.‚Äô  One of the best pieces of advice my dad gave me. I applied that to not just food but life and it became good advice. Funny how parents turn out to be so much smarter than we think they are when we are kids hahaha. Just kidding.`],
[`Respectfully, bc ily and this video Beryl, I'm excited to see another video in this series that focuses on regional american foods from non-white or non-european american communities (or commentaries about the origins of each dish)! this is a huge country with so many people so many histories, I would just love to see more.`],
[`Lovely video, as always :) 

I know this was about the regional differences in modern (past 100 or so years) American foods, but I think it would be really cool if you one day did an episode about the foods of the Indigenous people of America! It fascinates me that there are certain ingredients (such as dairy) that are completely omitted in most if not all Native American recipes; instead, you'll find the inclusion of things like chokeberries, which many people (including myself) know nothing about! I think the history of Native American food culture is super interesting, incredibly varied and deeply complex, sometimes in unexpected ways - just consider the controversial significance of frybread, for example. 

Anyway, awesome stuff, looking forward to the next one!`],
[`Places that have short growing seasons will rely heavily on canned, pickled and processed foods. It makes sense the American mid West and the Canadian prairies would traditionally have these types of foods. Leafy greens and nightshades take lots of water and warm weather to grow. I live on the prairies, it snowed until the end of May and there were frost warnings until June. It probably will start to get cool again in mid August. If it wasn't for food imports from California and Mexico, we wouldn't be indulging in green salad today either.`],
[`‚ÄúPistachio pudding‚Äù is basically the lime dish but made with cool whip and pistachio pudding mix. Cherries are good in it too. I like it best out of that ambrosia salad family.`],

[`A quirky food that my family loves is called ‚ÄúStack ‚Äòem stuffed‚Äù and is a spicy, delicious, Frito salad. It‚Äôs like a taco salad and Hawaiian haystacks had a yummy love child. It came from my mom‚Äôs family in Michigan, and I ate it growing up in California, shared it with friends while at university in Washington state, and I now serve it to my kids in Utah!`],
[`Tater tot casserole was a staple in our house growing up in Tennessee. It's basically a deconstructed cheeseburger.`],
[`The thing about ‚Äúregional dishes‚Äù in the states is that it‚Äôs really according to the exact people you got it from in that region and what era.
We are truly a melting pot and what is considered potato salad in the south to one region- might not be the same literally a county away much less when you consider the family origins ( Indigenous Native Americans, African Americans, Italian German, French , Irish, Scottish, etc etc)
Also is that a coastal city or landlocked. 
So many factors.`],

[`There‚Äôs another Texas one called ‚ÄòFrito Pie‚Äô that I had never heard of till I moved here. It‚Äôs got Texas chili (canned with no beans), shredded Mexican or cheddar cheese, a bag of Fritos, jarred jalape√±o. Then you pour the meat cheese jalape√±o mixture into your tiny Frito bag and scoop it out with a spoon. It‚Äôs actually kinda good in a savory way.`],
[`I love that you did this episode & especially what Sam said about how there are no weird foods...there are just things that are unfamiliar to us. I feel like your channel really embodies that ethos in a way that is hopefully becoming less rare. 

I also really enjoyed the unexpected trip down memory lane this episode gave me! Both my grandmas were at best mediocre cooks, but one of them made a version of the lime jello salad that I LOVED as a kid. Hers didn't have marshmallows and used 7-Up instead of heavy cream though, so I think it was more light/refreshing and less decadant. I really want to try making Liz's family's version though & seeing how they compare!

My other grandmother would make a fruit salad for Thanksgiving/Christmas of frozen berries, grapes, and bananas. She would fold in homemade sweetened whipped cream & serve it with shredded coconut & mini marshmallows & nuts on the side for people to add as they wanted --  it's really only now I'm realizing that this was probably a version of ambrosia that she had adjusted over the years to her own tastes. 

If you do another episode, you should definitely do carne asada fries or a California burrito (which has fries & carne asada in it)!`],
[`I know this video is about food but the thing that attracted me the most was the cat collarüòÖ`],
[`In Australia we have something really similar to the Strawberry Pretzel Salad but we eat it as a dessert or out for coffee. Our version is just called a jelly slice and it's made of biscuit crumb base, sweetened condensed milk and gelatin  mix in the middle and jelly on top. We usually use strawberry jelly on top. It's really fun and interesting to find such similar recipes in other parts of the world! I love this series so much xx`],
[`I've had (and made) the lime jello salad (you can use raspberry jello too!) but it was way simpler.  I think it's called 24 hour jello salad.  You just dump a packet of jello mix (dry) and a tub of cottage cheese in a bowl.  Let it set up in your fridge overnight.  Quite nice on a hot day as a snack or with something spicy/hot.  Happy summer, Beryl!`],
[`Beryl, my mom always made tuna casserole which she learned from my grandma. It‚Äôs basically tuna, cream of mushroom, peas, and egg noddles topped with cheese and potato chips. It‚Äôs got every food category in one and my mom always paired it with homemade cornbread. Plus, it makes for some really good leftovers! üòä`],
[`I love that ‚Äúmulticultural‚Äù can be as inclusive as both Norwegian *and* German.  That said, it was SCANDALOUS when my Danish and Swedish great-greats married in the late 19th century.`],
[`When the first guy said Tater Tots are ‚Äúfancy‚Äù potatoes, I lost it.`],
[`I swear in the late 70's my mom was the queen of casseroles. My mom did a few versions of tatter tot casseroles. One was very similar to the one shown here but she would "doctor it up" by adding Worcestershire and dry mustard to the beef before mixing in the cream of mushroom soup. Sometimes she'd add extra saute'd mushrooms and she'd use a blend of cheeses. 
She also did one with Sloppy Joes under the tatter tots and a drizzle of BBQ sauce at the very end over the cheese. 
Every so often when I get nostalgic, I'll make mom's tatter tot casserole but I use Onion Tatter Tots. (Try this sometime!) 

As far as the Lime salad, I can only say this:

[`Hi beryl! I‚Äôm from Houston too and sometimes we add cheddar to the middle for those who don‚Äôt like cream cheese. And in another variation  whether it‚Äôs smoked or grilled it is often glazed with barbecue sauce. The sweet and acid in the sauce cuts the richness a little bit and really amps up the flavor. I definitely recommend giving it a try like that!üòÅ`],
[`My grandma and now I always make a "pink salad" for thanks giving and Christmas. It's cream cheese, jellied cranberry sauce, raspberry jello, and frozen raspberries. It's a Staple and something I always look forward to around the holidays`],
[`A regional Canadian dish from Nova Scotia, that I was introduced to as a child while living in Ontario because my babysitter was from Nova Scotia is called Tuna Treat:

For 2-3 people, you take a bag of plain rippled chips, open the bag and crush rhe chips. Dump them in a roasting pan. Add 1 can of Campbell's Mushroom Soup (I find other soups taste funny), 1 can or the equivilent of frozen, corn, mix well and 1 can of tuna, not drained.  Add milk until the everything is incorporated and there is still a wetness to it. (So that it doesn't burn). Pop in the oven uncovered for about 15-20 minutes. I always add black pepper to mine, but it doesnt need salt because of the chips. 

You can really switch up any of these ingredients to your liking, but this was such a comforting food as a child as is.`],
[`Something to keep in mind about America is that between the depression of the 30s, to then world War 2 with War time rations, food was not as abundant as it is today. People canned out of necessity.  My dad is palenstian and my moms family has been in American for at least 4 generations now, originally from Sweden. My maternal grandmother remembers making cake in the morning for her family to eat, and having beans on bread most days, because it's all they had. Corn casserole also came about due to lack of food, and though nuttionally lacking, is something still made to this day. Something else to keep in mind is this is a small snippet of food. America has so much diversity and many more dishes than this. You will met no American who thinks any of these salads is anything other than a dessert.`],
[`One of my favorite family dishes that we always made for special family gatherings is poppyseed dumplings. The dumpling wrapper is a mix of flour and bread crumbs,  inside is fruit usually prunes or apples with cinnamon sugar.  They're boiled and then covered with a mixture of ground poppyseeds,  sugar and butter.  Really more dessert than dinner but I love them so much. It was usually a birthday dinner request üòÅ`],
[`A regional dish I‚Äôve always love is red eye gravy on country ham. Country ham was my family‚Äôs go to breakfast meat for as long as I can remember.  I don‚Äôt really think bacon was much of a thing in my house growing up.  But anyway, you basically just fry up slices of country ham then deglaze the pan with coffee, water, and a pinch of sugar.  It really helps to balance the salty ham, and is wonderful to sop up with biscuits.`],

[`Strawberry pretzel salad!!! I love that stuff, it's perfect for when you need a fairly easy and light dessert (e.g. when you're making a ton of food but you still feel like there needs to be something sweet for afterwards).`],
[`Hi beryl, my family makes pretzel salad for almost any occasion and we usually use the looser form of a pretzel base that you seemed to struggle with in the video. To fix this, make the cream cheese layer looser by using whipped cream over cool whip. Also my family has used strawberries, raspberries, and mixed berries for the top layer with the jello and all are great! Hope this helps!`],

[`Haha I‚Äôm a Texan and had an armadillo egg last night! So yummy. Sometimes we put the sausage inside the jalape√±o instead of outside, but sometimes we don‚Äôt use it at all and just let the bacon serve as the protein.

[`I was so excited to see Tator Tot casserole!! I personally make a beef gravy instead of using cream of mushroom, I also mix in green beans and mushrooms.

[`An interesting dish for a part 2, or for a burgers (loose definition) video could be bierocks. I think they're only in KS and Nebraska.

[`This was awesome.  

If you decide to do a "Part 2" episode you should really look into Cincinnati Style Chili... aka... Chili Spaghetti!   

our chili is greek based instead of tex-mex based so its super runny,  doesnt include beans (can be added, see below), and has a distinctive taste.  You really shouldnt eat it alone like you can with tex-mex... you have to put it over something.  We put it over Spaghetti noodles or make Cheese Coneys out of them.  

For the Spaghetti dishes we call them 3 ways, 4 ways, or 5 ways.  

3-way = Spaghetti, chili, and cheese
4-way = Spaghetti, chili, cheese, and onions OR beans
5-way = Spaghetti, chili, cheese, onions, and beans. 

**disclaimer... for the cheese you want to use finely shredded cheddar cheese and you want to use a mountain of it.  Seriously, put enough cheese that you think its just too much then add another handful or two. 

I promise you its worth trying out!

Oh... and while Cincinnati style chili has a distinctive taste you can still do chili Spaghetti with tex-mex chili and, while different, is just as yummy.  I like to mix it up between the two because our chili tastes so different.`],
